## About Us
Microcontrollers and Autonomy Research And Development, commonly known as M&A R&D, is at the forefront of innovation. Our mission is to blend high-level software development with sophisticated embedded systems to deliver top-notch autonomous solutions.

## Team Structure
- **Software Development Team**: Our high-level code ninjas.
  - Sub-team: Project A - Building revolutionary software.
  - Sub-team: Project B - Innovating the user experience.
- **Embedded Systems Team**: The hardware wizards.
  - Sub-team: Project C - Crafting smart firmware.
  - Sub-team: Project D - Integrating seamless hardware solutions.

## Repository Structure
- **software-projectA**: Repository for Project A under Software Development.
- **embedded-projectC**: Repository for Project C under Embedded Systems.
- **common-libraries**: Shared code and libraries.

## Coding Standards
- **Consistency is Key**: Adhere to the coding style guides for each programming language we use.
  - Python: Follow [PEP 8](https://pep8.org/).
  - C++: Follow the [Google Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).
  - JavaScript: Use the [Airbnb Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript).
- **Code Reviews**: All code changes must be peer-reviewed and approved before merging.
- **Automated Linters and Formatters**: Utilize tools like pylint for Python, clang-format for C++, and ESLint for JavaScript to enforce coding standards automatically.

## Contribution Guidelines
- **General Workflow:**
  1. **Fork the Repository:**
     - Navigate to the repository you want to contribute to.
     - Click the "Fork" button at the top right to create your own copy of the repository.
  2. **Create a Branch:**
     - From your forked repository, create a new branch for your feature or bugfix.
     - Naming convention for branches: `feature/<description>` or `bugfix/<description>`.
  3. **Write Meaningful Commits:**
     - Use [semantic commit messages](https://seesparkbox.com/foundry/semantic_commit_messages):
       - `feat`: A new feature.
       - `fix`: A bug fix.
       - `docs`: Documentation only changes.
       - `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, etc).
       - `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature.
       - `test`: Adding missing or correcting existing tests.
       - `chore`: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation generation.
     - Example: `feat: add user authentication module`.
  4. **Commit Regularly:**
     - Commit small, incremental changes. Avoid large, monolithic commits.
     - Each commit should do one thing and do it well.
  5. **Push and Create a Pull Request:**
     - Push your branch to your forked repository.
     - Navigate to the original repository and create a pull request from your branch.
     - Provide a clear and concise description of your changes in the pull request.
  6. **Code Review:**
     - Your pull request will be reviewed by your peers.
     - Address any feedback or requested changes.
     - Once approved, your changes will be merged into the main branch.

## Repository Management
- **Repository Structure:**
  - **Naming Conventions:** Use clear and descriptive names for repositories, e.g., `projectA-software`, `projectB-embedded`.
  - **README Files:** Each repository should contain a README.md file with:
    - Project description.
    - Setup instructions.
    - Contribution guidelines specific to the project.
    - License information.
- **Branch Management:**
  - **Main Branch:** The stable production-ready code.
  - **Development Branch:** Where all new features and fixes are merged before being released to the main branch.
  - **Feature Branches:** Branches for individual features or bug fixes, named `feature/<description>` or `bugfix/<description>`.
- **Pull Requests:**
  - All changes must go through a pull request and be reviewed.
  - Use templates for pull requests to ensure consistency. Example template:

    ```markdown
    ### Summary
    Provide a brief description of the changes.

    ### Related Issues
    List any related issues, e.g., `Closes #123`.

    ### Changes
    - [x] List of changes made.

    ### Checklist
    - [ ] Tests added or updated.
    - [ ] Documentation updated.
    - [ ] Code follows coding standards.
    ```

- **Automated Testing:**
  - Set up continuous integration (CI) to run automated tests on each pull request.
  - Use services like GitHub Actions, Travis CI, or CircleCI.

## Communication
- **GitHub Issues:**
  - Use GitHub Issues for tracking bugs, feature requests, and tasks.
  - Use labels to categorize issues (e.g., `bug`, `enhancement`, `documentation`).
- **Team Meetings:**
  - Regular meetings every Thursday to discuss progress and roadblocks.
  - Use meeting agendas and minutes to keep track of discussions and decisions.
- **Daily Communication:**
  - Use Messenger or ClickUp for day-to-day communication.
  - Create channels for different teams and projects to keep discussions organized.
- **Documentation:**
  - Maintain thorough documentation for all projects.
  - Use GitHub Wikis or a documentation generator like Sphinx for Python or Doxygen for C++.
